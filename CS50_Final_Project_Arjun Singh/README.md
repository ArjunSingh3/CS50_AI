#### Description:
This was one of my biggest projects in computer science. I wanted to do something meaningful that can help people. While I was in my first electrical engineering course our engineering advisor gave us a physical form. We had to choose the classes for the first two years of our degree. It was important as those courses had to fulfill the pre-requisites for Junior year.

In college not everyone has a printer and printing multiple papers in case someone messes up is difficult. Therefore, I built a website to automate the whole process. Students using the website can add and delete classes form the course. It will make the process easier and something that students can edit anytime.

During the process I ran into many problems. I learned how to debug my code using inspect and print statements. It has helped me to become better at finding and solving coding problems and have a significant impact learning.

I built an additional functionality that only works the first time a user logs in. The web application asks the users for their start and graduations year and term. This helps me to build the tables. once logged in the tables are divided into 4 terms: Spring, Summer, Winter, and Fall. students can choose the specific year and term their classes will be in. The students can also choose the credit hours for each of the classes.

The tables also keep track of the total credit hours for each term. When I went through the process of choosing my classes I had to build a similar table in excel. I would add different classes and their credit hours in it. That process is tedious and to make it more efficient the web application has these features.

The best part is that students after loading all their classes can print the table out or go their advisor and ask them about their chosen classes. This makes it incredibly easy for the students to edit classes and add new ones if their advisor suggests something.

The history function was much easier as I passed in all the data from the databases. The creation if the databases was tricky in the starting. I learned to create my own databases from scratch (no pun intended). I had to edit them add new columns to make the process more efficient.

I ran into problems with the delete button. I learned to choose a column from the database and convert it into a list. This helped me to build a delete function as well. I hope this web application can help students, as I am planning on adding more features like GPA calculation whose data will delete automatically once you log out. This is important for student's privacy.

These are small problems that make a huge difference in our lives. I have learned how to build a web application this summer. I will build on my knowledge to build more apps and bigger programming projects to have an even bigger impact.
